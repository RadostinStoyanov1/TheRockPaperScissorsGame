The winner is the one whose choice beats the opponent's choice. The rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper, and the paper beats the rock.
The player's opponent is the computer. Computer's choices are based on creating a random integer. This version of the game is made with higher chance of win for the player, as the random values of the integer creation are bounded to 4 values instead of 3 (paper, rock and scissors). The fourth integer is set to check the players choice and generate always losing choice for the computer.
